## Team Plater Attitude
If I worked with a teammate on this project, I’d make sure we communicate well and I’d be open to feedback and always ready to help with any part of the code if needed.

## Eagerness to Learn
If I had more time, I’d probably try to add a real database instead of using an in-memory one, because it would make it better for the future.
